# PDF Summarizer using Google Gemini AI

## 📌 Overview

This project is a powerful PDF summarizer that:

- Extracts text from uploaded PDF files
- Cleans and preprocesses the extracted content
- Identifies top keywords and key phrases
- Generates a short and concise summary
- Optionally enhances the summary using Google Gemini AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash Model)

The summarizer is ideal for academic papers, research articles, lengthy reports, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Extract text from multi-page PDFs
- ✅ Clean and preprocess noisy input text
- ✅ Detect and print top keywords
- ✅ Identify and list noun phrases (key phrases)
- ✅ Generate a human-like AI summary using Google Gemini
- ✅ Compatible with Google Colab or local Python environment

## 🛠️ Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using the commands below.

### For Google Colab:

```python
!pip install PyPDF2 google-generativeai nltk spacy
!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### For Local Python Environment:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 google-generativeai nltk spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Additionally, the following NLTK resources will be automatically downloaded:

```python
nltk.download('punkt', force=True)
nltk.download('stopwords', force=True)
```

## 📄 How It Works

1. Upload a PDF file (via Colab or local input)
2. The file is parsed using PyPDF2
3. Text is cleaned using regex
4. Tokenization and stopword removal extract meaningful keywords
5. spaCy extracts multi-word noun phrases
6. A brief summary is created
7. The AI-enhanced summary is generated by Gemini (if enabled)

## 💡 Use Cases

- 📚 Academic paper summarization
- 📰 Condensing news articles or reports
- 📄 Corporate documentation simplification
- 🔍 Legal document preprocessing
- 🧠 Research paper revision

## 🔧 Implementation Tips

- Best used in **Google Colab** for quick file uploads and environment setup
- Avoid uploading scanned PDFs without OCR support
- The summary length can be adjusted by modifying the `target_words` parameter
- Review extracted keywords/phrases to guide summary generation
